    <ul>
      <li>I like the explanation they put on the home page</li>
      <li>I like the FAQ section</li>
      <li>
        contrast is great ... they use basic bright colors that cathes my
        attention and it increases readablity of the materials presented
      </li>
      <li>the range input methods are great...safety</li>
      <li>
        Usability...Eficiency... I uploaded an image but don't see it on the
        display ! I dunno why
      </li>
      <li>
        the side display is amazing because the users can see the impact of
        their change
      </li>
      <li>
        I dont know which catagory it fails into but the small box under the
        image has a confusion placehoder text /** your CSS Code **/ in my first
        interaction i tried to write a css code in the box but it wont allow me
        to make changes. !!!!! From SAFETY perspective its great, but also
        confusion and the learnablity aspect in question ...it can be improved
        by using a clear placeholder text...like ... !!!!!!!!

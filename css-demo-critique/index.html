          I want to start with the things I like. I like the clear and concise
          explanation provided on the home page. It's great to see a learner
          website that doesn't overwhelm users with confusing layout options on
          the home page. The FAQ section is also helpful for quick access to
          common questions and answers. Well done by putting effort into making
          this website easy to navigate and understand
        </li>

        <li>
          Efficiency: While using the website, I noticed an issue with
          efficiency when uploading images. After uploading, I expected to see
          the image centered on the display so that I could make border changes
          and learn CSS. However, this wasn't the case - some images didn't
          appear or locate in weird positions. To improve the user experience, I
          suggest either showing a sample demo image (like a cat) in the center
          to help users learn CSS or modify the upload process to ensure that
          images are displayed correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learnability: However, I noticed a learnability issue interlinked with
          the efficiency problem mentioned earlier. I also observed a minor
          learnability issue as it took me some time to see the color bar on the
          page as it needed to be labeled appropriately. Better labeling of the
          color bar would help me avoid making the same mistake in the future
          and ultimately increase the site's learnability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learnability contd..: Unlike most web apps I have seen designed to
          teach CSS, this one is refreshingly simple and intuitive. The layout
          is well-designed, allowing users to observe the changes they make in
          real time and providing them with the CSS code that leads to the
          change. This is an excellent feature as it allows users to learn by
          seeing the result and examining the code that produces it. Overall,
          I'm impressed with the user experience of this website and how it
          facilitates learning CSS straightforwardly and practically.

          Safety: In terms of safety, this web app has adopted a conservative
          approach to prevent errors. It utilizes range sliders to change values
          and display the output, which is a great way to ensure safety.
          However, allowing users to change some values could be a great
          improvement, considering it is a learning app to improve CSS
          proficiency. Giving users more control over the tool could encourage
          them to experiment and learn more about CSS. While the current safety
          measures are compelling, additional flexibility could make the app
          more engaging and valuable for users.

        Smooth shadow generator.
        <a href="https://shadows.brumm.af/"> Link</a>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Initially, I would like to appreciate the effectiveness of the shadow
          generator in presenting the overall web layout. The generator's simple
          and uncluttered design lets users quickly discern the CSS shadow
          effects while adjusting the values. Additionally, the display board's
          central location on the page ensures that users won't overlook it.
        </li>
        <li>
          One issue with the learnability of this product is that, despite the
          designers' effective use of descriptive labels for all the range
          adjusters, they still need to provide specific guidance on how to use
          the pink adjusters. While the labels are a good start, a more detailed
          explanation or even just a few lines of text could greatly benefit
          users in navigating the learning process. By clarifying the purpose
          and function of the pink adjusters, users can feel more confident in
          their ability to use the product effectively and efficiently. Overall,
          enhancing the learnability of this product through improved labeling
          and explanations could significantly improve the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of effectiveness, this product's range functions generally
          worked as expected, with one notable exception: the Reduced spread
          range adjuster. Despite repeated attempts to use the range
          functionality, I could not make any changes using this function.
          However, overall, the web interface performed well in terms of
          efficiency, and I appreciated the ease with which I could adjust the
          other range functions. This product could become even more effective
          and efficient for users by resolving the issue with the Reduced spread
          range adjuster.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regarding safety, they give users flexibility and allow them to learn
          by doing. However, one area where this app could be improved is
          setting appropriate boundaries for the pink adjusters. Although they
          limit the adjusters' length to some extent, extending them beyond the
          intended edge is still possible. In my case, I inadvertently set the
          red adjuster on the top of the final transparency range adjuster.
          After making a few changes to other sections of the shadow selection,
          I had to adjust the values I had set to regain access to the final
          transparency range selector because I accidentally placed the pink
          selector on the top of it. This experience highlights the need for
          more explicit boundaries and practical guidance for users to prevent
          unintended consequences and ensure safe and successful product use. By
          improving the app's safety through better boundary setting and
          guidance, users can feel more confident using the product effectively
          and with less room for mistakes.
